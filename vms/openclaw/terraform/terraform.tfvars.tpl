# vms/openclaw/terraform/terraform.tfvars.tpl
#
# Hydrate template for scripts/hydrate.sh. Each `kp://Homelab/...`
# placeholder is resolved against KeePassXC via `keepassxc-cli show`
# and the result is written to terraform.tfvars (gitignored, 0600).
#
# Placeholder syntax: kp://<group-path>/<entry-name>[#<field>]
#
# For a manual workflow (no KeePassXC), copy terraform.tfvars.example
# instead and fill in real values directly.
